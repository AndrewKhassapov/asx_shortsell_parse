# ASX short-sell list parser.

A project created initially to read the data from the [Australian Stock Exchange shortsell list](https://www.asx.com.au/data/shortsell.txt) and sort the information to track the most shorted ASX stocks.

*This will be progressively updated to build into a web-based user interface.*
